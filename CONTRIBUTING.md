# Contributing Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this portfolio! To maintain code quality and ensure a smooth review process, please follow these guidelines.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following installed locally:

- **Node.js**: `20.18.x` or later (`node -v`)
- **pnpm**: `9.15.x` or later (`pnpm -v`)
- **Git**: Latest version

---

## 2. Development Workflow

### Step 1: Fork & Clone

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone your fork:
git clone https://github.com/jakirulislamhakim/latest-portfolio.git
cd latest-portfolio
pnpm install
```

### Step 2: Create a Feature Branch

Always create your branch off the **`development`** branch (never off `main`):

```bash
git checkout development
git pull origin development
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

#### Branch Naming Conventions:

- `feature/*` — New pages, UI components, or features
- `fix/*` — Bug fixes or visual corrections
- `perf/*` — Performance optimizations
- `docs/*` — Documentation improvements
- `refactor/*` — Code restructuring without feature changes
- `chore/*` — Tooling, dependency, or config updates

### Step 3: Run Locally & Make Changes

Start the Next.js local development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to preview your changes in real-time.

### Step 4: Validate Code Quality

Before committing, ensure all automated verification checks pass:

```bash
pnpm lint          # ESLint check
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript strict compilation check
pnpm format:check  # Prettier style check
pnpm build         # Production Next.js build verification
```

### Step 5: Commit with Conventional Commits

Commit messages must strictly follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add animated skill tags component"
git commit -m "fix: resolve navigation drawer scroll lock on mobile"
```

> **Automated Git Hooks (Husky):**
> Upon committing, Husky will run `lint-staged` and validate your commit message format with `commitlint`. Commits violating the format will be rejected locally.

### Step 6: Push & Open a Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **All Pull Requests MUST target the `development` branch.**
> PRs directly targeting `main` will be automatically rejected by CI branch validation rules.

## 3. Pull Request Checklist

When opening a Pull Request:

- [ ] PR targets the `development` branch.
- [ ] PR title adheres to Conventional Commits (e.g., `feat: ...`, `fix: ...`).
- [ ] All CI checks pass (lint, typecheck, format, build, and security scans).
- [ ] The PR template description and checklist are completed.
- [ ] Screenshots or recordings are provided for any visual UI changes.

## 4. Code Style & Standards

- **Imports**: Always use the `@/*` alias for internal paths (`@/components/...`, `@/lib/...`).
- **Types**: Use explicit type imports: `import type { ComponentProps } from 'react'`.
- **Variables**: Prefix intentionally unused variables with an underscore (e.g., `_event`).
- **Formatting**: Enforced via Prettier — avoid manual reformatting outside project rules.
- **Logging**: Never leave `console.log` in production code; use `console.warn` or `console.error` only when necessary.

---

## 5. Release Process (Maintainers Only)

1. PRs are reviewed and merged into `development`.
2. A promotion PR is created from `development` → `main`.
3. After merging into `main`, the **Release workflow** is triggered via GitHub Actions.
4. The workflow calculates the SemVer bump, updates `package.json`, tags the commit, and creates a GitHub Release.
